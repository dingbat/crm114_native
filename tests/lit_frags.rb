ALICE1 = \
"Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversations?'
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her."

ALICE2 = \
"There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well."

ALICE3 = \
"Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it."

ALICE4 = \
"Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! 'I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) '—yes, that's about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)"

ALICE5 = \
"Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—' (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) '—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'"

HAMLET1 = \
"King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guil-
denstern!
Moreover that we much did long to see you, 
The need we have to use you did provoke 
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard 
Of Hamlet's transformation; so I call it, 
Since nor the exterior nor the inward man 
Resembles that it was. What it should be 
More than his father's death, that thus hath put
him 
So much from the understanding of himself, 
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both, 
That, being of so young days brought up with
him, 
And since so neighboured to his youth and
humour, 
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court 
Some little time; so by your companies 
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather, 
So much as from occasion you may glean, 
Whe'r aught to us unknown afflicts him thus, 
That, open'd, lies within our remedies"

HAMLET2 = \
"Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd 
of you;
And sure I am two men there are not living 
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
To show us so much gentry and good will
As to expend your time with us awhile,
For the supply and profit of our hope, 
Your visitation shall receive such thanks
As fits a king's remembrance.
Ros. Both your majesties 
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, 
Put your dread pleasures more into command 
Than to entreaty.
Guil. But we both obey, 
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent, 
To lay our service freely at your feet, 
To be commanded"

HAMLET3 = \
"Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guil- 
denstern.
Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle 
Rosencrantz;
And I beseech you instantly to visit 
My too much changed son. Go, some of you, 
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is. 
Guil. Heavens make our presence, and our
practices 
Pleasant and helpful to him! 
Queen. Ay, amen"

HAMLET4 = \
"Look here, upon this picture, and on
this; 
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers. 
See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself, 
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command,
A station like the herald Mercury
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill,
A combination and a form indeed, 
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man.
This was your husband: look you now, what
follows.
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear, 
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you
eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed, 
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes"

HAMLET5 = \
"You cannot call it love, for at your age 
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble, 
And waits upon the judgment; and what judg- 
ment 
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you
have, 
Else could you not have motion; but sure, that
sense 
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err, 
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd 
But it reserv'd some quantity of choice, 
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't 
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind? 
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, 
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all, 
Or but a sickly part of one true sense 
Could not so mope. 
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious
hell,
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones, 
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax, 
And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame 
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge, 
Since frost itself as actively doth burn, 
And reason panders will"
